# Hack the Burgh VIII - Verble!

## Etymology

It's [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) but verbal, hence _verble_.

Now (thanks to domain.com) it's hosted at [verble.tech](https://verble.tech).

## Inspiration

It's the a spin on the modern instant classic wordle, except you speak your words. The speech to text is provided by AssemblyAI's API.

## Technologies
- React for main app
- NodeJS for server
- From scratch HTML/ CSS

## Challenges
- Hosting (team lacks the arcane knowledge apparently required to use google cloud hosting)
- We did a web project again despite that face we both hate web dev
- Had to recreate wordle from scratch
- Looking stupid as we shouted **"TRY ADIEU TRY ADIEU"** at our computers at 2am

## Achievements
- Very responsive design - works across literally every device we had at our table
- It's up and hosted (after blood sweat and CORS-induced tears)
